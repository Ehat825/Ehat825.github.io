<h2>Unit 1: Data Tools</h2>
<p>This unit dealt with some basic statistics and methods of graphically representing data.
I skimmed the articles and went straight to the test because I’ve already taken statistics.
I know that most large datasets are stored as Comma Separated Values and then imported into some other program to do statistics on
</p>
<h2>Unit 2: Big data</h2>
<p>This unit was about (surprise) big data. How it is gathered, and the challenges in storing and interpreting it. My key takeaways were that images and audio files are harder to store than text, and that you can’t do statistics on data you don’t have.
</p>
<h2>Unit 3: Bias in machine learning
</h2>
<p>This unit was about  how biases present in data can be reflected in attempts to use this data. While I found it interesting, there was one genre of question on the tests I didn’t really like. When it asked for an application of these algorithms that we had shown to be biased that would not be biased. That does not make any sense, admittedly simply producing a pie chart for some biased data does not inherently perpetuate discrimination, but the assumption here is that this flawed data and its visualizations will be used to some end, so for every question that was of the form “which one of these applications won’t reproduce the bias” the answer should always be “none of the above”.
</p>
<h2>Unit test</h2>
<p>I found the unit test pretty easy, it was just a summary of the first  three units. Since I’ve already taken probability and statistics I was familiar with most of this already. This course is a pretty good introduction to data science.

<h2> Data analysis <\h2>

<p> For data analysis I chose to use <a href =https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/fdic-failed-bank-list> this list of failed banks <\a> found on Data.gov. For my question I chose "are more banks failing per year?" and the answer was a resounding no. I used google sheets to generate this chart, trying to get sheets to play nice with the original data was annoying, so I went through by hand and tallied how many banks had failed each year into a separate spreadsheet.<\p>
